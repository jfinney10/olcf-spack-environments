# OLCF Spack Environments

This repo contains the infrastructure and environment definitions to deploy
site-provided software on OLCF resources via Spack environments.

## Spack Fork

The upstream development branch of spack is not used directly. Instead, the OLCF
has implemented some customizations that are tracked in the "olcf" branch of a
personal spack fork located at https://github.com/mpbelhorn/olcf-spack.git.
